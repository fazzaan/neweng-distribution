### neweng-distribution
A repo to distribute NewEng, with info, guidelines, phases and sample materials.

_Ν.Β. [neweng-distribution / Posters and stuff](https://github.com/fazzaan/neweng-distribution/tree/main/Posters%20and%20stuff) should be in sync with [educational-resources / NewEng alphabet](https://github.com/fazzaan/educational-resources/tree/main/English/NewEng%20alphabet%20(Farran's))_
_If anyone can show me a super simple way to keep directories from separate repositories in sync, please message me!_
